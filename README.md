  <summary>Click to expand</summary>
 
 > *First i recommend using the .json Files, but if u want to have your API KEYS "hidden" aka more secure, you can also use `.env`, i created a `example.env` File which u should rename to `.env` and place in the keys etc. instead of in the config.json*
 
 1. Fill Out `config.json` add your token, but if you want your token to be secured add them in .env in varuables secrets the lock image
